# Summary

## Novelty of the project

As discussed in {ref}`section:identification_lift`, the current state-of-the-art unsteady lift models for viscous flows, such as those obtained in {cite}`brunton_reduced-order_2013`, are linear and contain reduced order balanced models of the transient flow effects of the lift. Models developed in this project can try to improve them mostly either by retaining accuracy in a higher range of angles of attack, and/or having lower complexity by using less states. Both improvements may be possible to obtain because of the project's choice of nonlinear identification methods, opening the possibility of capturing nonlinear flow phenomena and modeling a bigger part of the dynamics using the basic states (integrals of the inputs, perhaps also $C_L^X$). The results shown in {ref}`section:results_theodorsen` seem to confirm the latter effect in the range of inviscid flow.

Another potentially valuable contribution of the project is the application of multivariate orthogonal polynomials as base functions for the SINDy algorithm, which seems to offer very beneficial properties.

## Current achievements

The literature review and computations performed up to this point have acquainted the authors of the project with most of the topics necessary for the successful completion of the project, in terms of both unsteady lift modelling and system identification. Some of the concepts have already been applied, others will play a major role in later phases of the work.

The linearised Theodorsen model from {cite}`brunton2013empirical` has been succesfully implemented in Python, as shown in {ref}`section:theodorsen_implementation`, enabling rapid generation of training and validation data for the first stage of system identification procedures. An accurate evaluation of the Wagner function and a state-space model that approximates it, identified using SINDy and therefore reproducing the results from {cite}`dawson2022improved`, have been computed and described in {ref}`section:results_wagner`.

A method of computing a multivariate orthonormal polynomial basis for nonlinear state-space models has been described in {ref}`section:polynomial_chaos` and implemented in {ref}`section:polynomial_chaos_code`. While its application to the identification of better unsteady lift models is still a work in progress, it is already a potential contribution to the field of nonlinear system identification.

Aside from the rather successful replication of the models from {cite}`brunton2013empirical` and {cite}`dawson2022improved`, a model with less states and decent performance has been identified in {ref}`section:results_theodorsen`. Importantly, the methodology used in that section should be directly applicable to data generated by CFD simulations.

## Further plans

Initial generation of inviscid CFD data should begin very soon. As soon as the identification procedures are able to identify good quality models based on this data, initial batches of viscous CFD simulations (DNS) can also be generated.

The current approach of eliminating reduced order transient flow effect states from the model and replacing them with $C_L$ and nonlinearities, presented in {ref}`section:results_theodorsen`, seems to be promising and will definitely be tested on the CFD data. However, it is very possible that extending the model by adding reduced order flow effect models might become necessary, especially in the case of viscous flows which exhibit more complex behavior. Those additional states will either be observable, and therefore estimated by some kind of state observer, or additional measurement data (e.g. of pressure at certain points on the airfoil) might become necessary. This approach, while definitely time-consuming, would directly build on the current state of the art, and therefore might be promising in terms of improving on it.

The bulk of the work for the coming months is the iterative, result-driven improvement of the overall system identification procedures, both in terms of the form of the identified models discussed above, as well as the methodology used to estimate their parameters, including the regression method, its base functions, type of training data used, and finally the validation of the resulting models. While the results of this long procedure are impossible to predict, it seems rather realistic to hope that the final results will at least achieve accuracy comparable to the state of the art (with some valuable exploratory work on the methodology itself). Of course, there are reasons to believe that even better results can be obtained.
