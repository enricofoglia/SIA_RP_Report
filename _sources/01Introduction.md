# Introduction

## Scope of the work and state of the art

The goal of the project here presented is to identify sparse and reliable models for the unsteady lift of an airfoil undergoing a general motion purely from data captured from simulations of increasing complexity. 

Classical analytical models already exist in the framework of potential flow theory. In particular Theodorsen computed a frequency domain function that model a delay and scaling effect of sinusoidal variations of vertical position and angle of attack {cite}`theodorsen1979`. This model has been computed in the time domain for impulsive chages in angle of attack by Wagner {cite}`dawson2021` generalised by Von K치rm치n for arbitrary motion {cite}`VonKarman1938`. However, both this time-domain approaches involve integration of the complex Theodorsen function or of the distribution of vorticity in the wake, and can be thus impractical to compute in many real time applications. Moreover, their true limit lies in the assumption of potential flow, that disregard completely any effect due to viscosity. 

Nonetheless, improvements on the classical models have been made in recent years, allowing to apply them to wings of finite span {cite}`boutet2018` or viscous flow for low frequecy oscillations {cite}`liu2015`. In fact it has been proved by Limacher that the classical separation in added mass and circulatory forces already identified by Theodorsen and Von K치rm치n is indeed more general and applies beyond potential flow theory {cite}`Limacher2018`. By utilising data from more and more accurate simulations of the phenomenon, we expect to be able to find models that can outperform those proposed up until this point, and for them to be interpretable enough as to allow a physical interpretation of the single terms in the same way classical studies did for inviscid flows. In oreder to do so we have employed a machine learning algorithm developed by prof. Brunton and collegues called System Identification for Non-linear Dynamics (or SINDy) {cite}`brunton2016_SINDy`. The attractiveness of this particular algorithm is due to the fact that it has a python implementation {cite}`kaptanoglu2021_PySINDy` and is optimised to retrieve sparse models, i.e. with as little terms as possible. This will help the generalisation of the model and its interpretability.

## Applications

The project here presented is not just a thought exercise in order to go beyond classical analytical models with modern machine learning techniques. The need for precise and interpretable models for airfoils in unsteady flow conditions is felt in diverse fields of the aerospace industry.

The first analytical models by Wagner and Theodorsen can be applied to the prediction of the onset of flutter and the structural response of a wing to a gust of various shapes {cite}`CHIOCCHIA`.

The forward flight of an helicopter induces on the rotor a cyclic load due to the fact that the blade encounters a flow with a changing velocity due to the summation of the linear and rotating motion. The prediction of such loads, and thus of the lift force generated by the rotor, can only be made considering the time-varying nature of the flow {cite}`johnson2013`. 

Another emerging field where unsteady airfoil aerodynamics comes into play is Boundary Layer Ingestion engines. Such systems are projected to have up to a 19\% efficiency increment over conventional configurations (considering the overall system improvement {cite}`uranga2018`) and are thus studied with great attention. However, due to the presence at the inlet of a varying velocity field, the fan blades undergo time varying loading that can result in flutter or fatigue damage {cite}`bakhle2018`.

The intrinsic unsteadyness of the flow generates acoustic waves that propagate from the airfoil. This noises can, in fact, be of considerable intensity when it come to the biggest rotors, and can be a deal braker in those situations where a low acoustic footprint is paramount, like in the case of urban air mobility using drone-like vehicles <span style="color: red;">citation needed</span>.
